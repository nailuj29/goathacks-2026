Also known as "Fact Social", this Instagram-like app can be used by citizens living under oppressive governments to communicate secretly without government oversight by storing encrypted messages in the images posted using steganography.

The frontend to encrypt and store messages is securely hidden from users, only accessible by clicking a secret button.
